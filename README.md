# Predicting Sales Volume and Profitability
Multiple regression analysis to help the sales team decide on potential new products

## Overview
The sales team is considering adding some new products to the companys's product mix. They have shortlisted 24 that fit the company's business strategy, but now they need help narrowing the list. Our objective is to help the sales team by predicting the profitability of the potential new products.

Specifically, the sales team is interested in how certain product types perform against each other. Analyze historical sales data and make sales volume predictions for the potential new products, in order to better understand how types of products might impact sales across the enterprise.

Analyze with the goals of:
- Predicting sales of four different product types: PC, Laptops, Netbooks and Smartphones 
- Assessing the impact service reviews and customer reviews have on sales of different product types

You can find the datasets in the data folder. The file labelled ***existingproductattributes2017.csv*** is the dataset with information about the current products, and is the data you will train your model and build the predictive model. The file ***newproductattributes2017.csv*** is the list of the new products, where you will apply your model to predict the sales volume.
